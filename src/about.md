## History

This project started at [Hitch](https://www.hitchhq.com/). We are in love with API machine-readable documentation formats (OpenAPI, RAML, etc.) and always encouraged our customers to use a machine-readable definition for their APIs because it allows them to get extra benefits. From documentation and code generation to setup their own [API Assistant](http://apiassistant.com).

Internally, we used a message-driven microservices architecture and we couldn't have all those tools that we have with the HTTP APIs. All those things you get because you have your API defined with a machine-readable documentation format. And, on top of that, we noticed that some of our customers were creating IoT APIs over MQTT and they couldn't get all the benefits from Hitch because the existing specifications don't support message-driven APIs.

**It was time to come up with something good enough for everyone instead of having every company doing its own battle. We can learn a lot together if we join forces, so we decided to create AsyncAPI!**
